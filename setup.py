"""
pyramid_mailer is a package for taking the pain out of sending emails
in your Pyramid project.

This includes:

1. Wrapping the low-level Python email library with an easy-to-use
   API, which includes attachments and mulipart content.

2. Send emails immediately or to add to a maildir queue.

3. Managing email sends inside a transaction, to prevent emails being sent
   if your code fails.

4. Features to help with unit testing.

pyramid_mailer uses the repoze_sendmail library for managing email sending
and transacton management, and borrows code from Zed Shaw's Lamson for
wrapping email messages.
