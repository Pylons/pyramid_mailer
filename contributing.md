## Running tests and building documentation

We use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to automate test running, coverage, and building documentation across all supported Python versions.

To run everything configured in the `tox.ini` file:

    $ tox

To run tests on Python 2 and 3, and ensure full coverage, but exclude building of docs:

    $ tox -e py2-cover,py3-cover,coverage

To build the docs only:

    $ tox -e docs

See the `tox.ini` file for details.
